The general purpose of this project is to classify a particular medicine vs other medicines for an autonomous classifier
device . There could be huge application of this project in the material handling industry where medicine material handling requires
high level of precision to reduce human error in identifying a particular medicine and supplying right medicine to its consumer. Two
different neural networks are used to demonstrate classification methods that could help fellow developer of the project. The raw data
for the first one is supplied by Udacity Robotic Inference training team and the raw data for the second network was collected by
individual/s worked for this project.
